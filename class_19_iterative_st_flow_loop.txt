2. Iterative Statement :- 
---------------------------------------
if we want to execute a group of statement in multiple times then we should go for looping statement

There are two types of loop in python

1.for
2.while


for:- If we want to excute some action for every element present in some sequence like container[list,tuple,set,fzset,string etc] then we should go for for loops.


syntax:

for var in container:
	statement


ex:-

for i in data:
    result = i+100
    print(result)
